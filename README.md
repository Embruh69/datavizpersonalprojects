# Welcome to my Data Science Personal Projects collections
This repo is being used as a collection of my past personal Dataviz and Data Science projects.
Most, if not all are created in Jupyter and python.
Feel free to check them out and clone them if you feel like they are helpful.

# Data Analysis

created in order to answer the question, does poverty affect life expectancy of a country.

- [Medical Data](https://github.com/Embruh69/datavizpersonalprojects/blob/main/Medical%20Data.ipynb)

# Data Mining
- [Mortality](https://github.com/Embruh69/datavizpersonalprojects/blob/main/mortality.ipynb)
a simple data mining job, created in the goal of making a dataframe that will be used in tableau, you can check out the finished TableAU chart [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/TheInvisibleEnemyanoverviewofsuicideandtheirnumbers/Dashboard1?:language=en-US)

- [Sentiment](https://github.com/Embruh69/datavizpersonalprojects/blob/main/sentiment.ipynb)
a data mining, and sentiment analysis job. using twitter & steam review data to find out how people's opinion towards the game Battlefield 2042 has changed troughout the years.

# Data Science
- [Stroke Predictor](https://github.com/Embruh69/stroke-predictor-ANN-LogReg)
a data science project that aims to predict the probability and risk of someone getting a stroke. this project uses the neural network and logistic reggression algorithm to predict the needed values, you can see the finished application [here](https://embruh69-stroke-predictor-ann-logreg-deployment-xx98cx.streamlit.app/), you can also read the paper [here](https://github.com/Embruh69/stroke-predictor-ANN-LogReg/blob/main/NamaMahasiswa_NIM_IS411_B_UAS.pdf)
